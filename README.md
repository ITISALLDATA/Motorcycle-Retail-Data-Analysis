Together, these months accounted for 212 units sold, generating ₦297,450,000 in revenue. This contributed to 72% of the total annual revenue. These calculations are based on the data trends observed in the chart below. While the data shows a sales peak in Q4, further investigation is needed to confirm whether this is driven by foreign customers purchasing in bulk for holiday travel, as suggested by the manager.

### Motorcycle-Level Performance:

* In 2024, the Bajaj Boxer 100 was the best-selling motorcycle with 54 units sold, followed by the Honda Ace 110 Self Start and Haojue Lucky Plus, each with 36 units sold. Despite its higher sales volume, the Bajaj Boxer 100 generated less revenue, contributing ₦59,400,000 to the total revenue compared to the Honda CGL 125, which earned ₦72,500,000 due to its higher unit price.

* The Bajaj Boxer 100, however, led in profitability, generating ₦1,080,000, which accounted for 18% of the total profit. In comparison, the Honda Ace 110 Self Start and Haojue Lucky Plus each contributed 12% to the total profit. This highlights that while the Bajaj Boxer 100 is the customer favorite, it is also the business favorite due to its substantial profit contribution.

* The data indicates that customers prefer Honda self-start motorcycles over kick-start models, as evidenced by the sales pattern. Among the Honda Ace 110 models, the self-start type sold 36 units compared to 31 units for the kick-start type, reflecting a 16% higher preference. Similarly, for the Honda Ace 125, the self-start model outperformed the kick-start version, selling 26 units versus 19 units—a 37% higher preference.

* At the lower end of the sales spectrum, the Haojue UD sold only 16 units, making it the least-performing model in the lineup. While its performance is not drastically different from the next lowest model, it signals an area for potential improvement. This underperformance could be attributed to lower customer awareness, lack of unique selling points, or pricing factors.
