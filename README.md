### Sales Trends:

The business's sales peaked in the last quarter of the year, with 79 motorcycles sold in December, 72 in November, and 61 in October. Together, these months accounted for 212 units sold, generating ₦297,450,000 in revenue. This contributed to 72% of the total annual revenue. These calculations are based on the data trends observed in the chart below. While the data shows a sales peak in Q4, further investigation is needed to confirm whether this is driven by foreign customers purchasing in bulk for holiday travel, as suggested by the manager.

### Motorcycle-Level Performance:

* In 2024, the Bajaj Boxer 100 was the best-selling motorcycle with 54 units sold, followed by the Honda Ace 110 Self Start and Haojue Lucky Plus, each with 36 units sold. Despite its higher sales volume, the Bajaj Boxer 100 generated less revenue, contributing ₦59,400,000 to the total revenue compared to the Honda CGL 125, which earned ₦72,500,000 due to its higher unit price.

* The Bajaj Boxer 100, however, led in profitability, generating ₦1,080,000, which accounted for 18% of the total profit. In comparison, the Honda Ace 110 Self Start and Haojue Lucky Plus each contributed 12% to the total profit. This highlights that while the Bajaj Boxer 100 is the customer favorite, it is also the business favorite due to its substantial profit contribution.

* The data indicates that customers prefer Honda self-start motorcycles over kick-start models, as evidenced by the sales pattern. Among the Honda Ace 110 models, the self-start type sold 36 units compared to 31 units for the kick-start type, reflecting a 16% higher preference. Similarly, for the Honda Ace 125, the self-start model outperformed the kick-start version, selling 26 units versus 19 units—a 37% higher preference.

* At the lower end of the sales spectrum, the Haojue UD sold only 16 units, making it the least-performing model in the lineup. While its performance is not drastically different from the next lowest model, it signals an area for potential improvement. This underperformance could be attributed to lower customer awareness, lack of unique selling points, or pricing factors.

### Customer-Level Performance and Behavior:

* In 2024, the top 5 customers contributed ₦171,350,000 to the total revenue, accounting for 41.8% of the annual revenue. They also generated ₦2,500,000 in profit, representing 41.6%, and purchased a total of 125 motorcycles, which is 41.6% of the total units sold. In comparison, the bottom 5 customers contributed ₦66,750,000, which accounts for 16% of the annual revenue, generated ₦1,000,000 in profit (16%), and purchased 50 motorcycles.

* Emeka Adeyemi was the highest contributor to the business's revenue in 2024, generating ₦36,750,000 in revenue and ₦520,000 in profit from the purchase of 26 motorcycles. However, their average days between purchases are relatively high compared to Ifeoma Ibrahim, who returns every 13 days. While Ifeoma generated less revenue, profit, and bought fewer motorcycles overall, their shorter average days between purchases indicate a potential opportunity to increase their spending.

* David Nwachukwu ranked as the second-highest contributor in terms of revenue, profit, and total units sold. However, their average days between purchases are shorter than Emeka's. Further analysis is needed to explore ways to encourage David to increase spending during each purchase to maximize their contribution to the business.

## Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendation is provided:

* Capitalize on the popularity of the Bajaj Boxer 100, Honda Ace 110 Self Start, and Haojue Lucky Plus by ensuring adequate stock availability year-round. Promote these models through advertisements highlighting their benefits, such as reliability and affordability.
  
* Develop strategies to improve the sales of underperforming models, such as the Haojue UD. Potential approaches include:
  
    1. Highlighting its unique selling points (e.g., fuel efficiency or affordability).
    2. Offering limited-time discounts or bundle packages to make it more attractive.
       
* Foster deeper relationships with top-performing customers like Emeka Adeyemi, David Nwachukwu, and Ifeoma Ibrahim. Develop exclusive benefits to encourage increased spending and retention.
  
* Focus on customers with shorter intervals between purchases (e.g., Ifeoma Ibrahim). These frequent buyers could be encouraged to increase their average spending through personalized offers for premium models.
  
* While Bajaj Boxer 100 leads in unit sales and profit, the Honda CGL 125 generates more revenue per unit. Explore strategies to maximize revenue and profitability for high-demand models.
